- About Me
	- Hi, I'm Kifah. I'm researching the intersection of complex systems and tools for thought. I believe they will help with most of my/our current problems.
- About these notes
	- My aim here is to make this a place I can actually think - not to make my progress so far legible.
		- I tried that last time, the focus on legibility made my notes inflexible. I'm not motivated by sharing what I already know.
	- I'm mostly going to be writing about the nature of information, [[Tools for Thought]], programming.
		- Might throw in some stuff about [[biohacking]] [[nootropics]] [[ADHD]] in the future.
