- About Me
	- Hi, I'm Kifah. I'm interested in the intersection of complex systems and tools for thought. I believe they will help with most of our current problems.
- About these notes
	- My previous attempt at a second brain was mostly unidirectional - I set it up to share what I'd found - and the focus on legibility made my notes inflexible. I'm not motivated by sharing what I already know.
	- My aim here is to actually use this website to make progress on my problems- in public.
	-
	- I'm mostly going to be writing about the nature of information, [[Tools for Thought]], programming.
		- Might throw in some stuff about [[biohacking]] [[nootropics]] [[ADHD]] in the future.
