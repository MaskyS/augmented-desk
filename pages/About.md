- About Me
	- Hi, I'm Kifah. I'm researching the intersection of [[complex systems]] and [[Tools for Thought]]. I believe they will help with most of [our most pressing problems]([[Open Questions+Problems]]).
- About these notes
	- My aim here is to make this a public place I can actually think.
		- I'm not optimizing for legibility-- the last time I tried that,
			- And I found that I was less motivated to write about what I already knew than digging deeper.
- See the sidebar for some entry points.
