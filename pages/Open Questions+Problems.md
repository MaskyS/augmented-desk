- Questions #[[Feynman Algorithm]]
	- How do we overcome virality?
		- E.g. lower dimensional ideas spreading faster than nuanced ones, lies vs truth, churn of amateurish resources vs slow accumulation of expert knowledge, polarizing news, etc
	- How do we learn to see?
		- I believe visual thinking is a skill that can be trained. Has anybody built a list of useful interpretations of the data our eyes receive?
			- What seemingly mundane details hold the most important secrets? As [[Douglas R. Hofstadter]] said, “This idea that there is generality in the specific is of far-reaching importance.”
			- For example, what does the color of a house, or the brand of a car say about a person? How are the trees in an area and relative wealth correlated? Admittedly these are weak examples, but I’m sure there are more.
				- In pop culture, this is often referred to [[deductionism]]— Sherlock-like skills of observation. - Two popular gathering spots online for enthusiasts is r/deduction and r/scienceofdeduction, but I haven’t really found much here.

	- What do we need to create general-purpose [[multi-scale modeling]]?
		- How can you simultaneously see effects at the microscopic and macroscopic level?

	- What pieces of knowledge or subjects do you know that are the most compoundable?
		- What are the things that are the most ‘hookable’? That easily associate with a variety of new knowledge?
			- [[Related to]]
				- You could say I’m looking for [the ultimate prototypes]([[Steve Yegge]]), with the most versatile properties.

	- How can we prevent information overload?
	- How can we create an emergent internet?
	- What does [[Git]] for ideas look like?
	- How can we effectively leverage the wisdom of the crowds?
	- What do good user interfaces look like for creating your own feeds/curation engines?
	- Before punctuation was invented, we wrote words inalongstreamofletters. What's the 21st century equivalent of punctuation?
	- What are the best resources on complex systems?
	- How can you do [[deliberate practice]] with [[software engineering]]?
		- Are there classic works to study?
		- [[Andy Matuschak/Knowledge work rarely involves deliberate practice]] [🔗](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5BMvN7tZr8wxZdfFHgjvV9Em5HzXPCboardR)
	- What does the intersection of browsers and game engines look like?
	- What are some principles for creating [[scale-free]] [[UI]]?
	- [[metadata matters]]. How can we make it scalable?
		- How can we let people annotate anything and everything - and then share it?

	- How can I generate flexible meal plans based off several parameters (macro/micro-nutrients, price, cooking duration, difficulty level, hunger level, available ingredients...)?
	- How can we create mediums that is infinitely fractal and continuous, where you can create explanations at any level of detail you want (similar to how you see).
		- This would let you see the dependency trees of concepts, or smoothly zoom in and out in terms of detail while reading/studying..
	- Experience produces abstraction- this means that math notation makes it easier for experts to collaborate/communicate, but they make it harder for beginners to absorb mental models. How can we change this?
		- See [[Bret Victor/Kill Math]]
	- How can we facilitate [[Hegelian dialectic]]? How can we make it easy to judge information on the internet according to our own metrics/epistemic theories of truth?
